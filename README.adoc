Project setup with which the SandboxPolicy.UNTRUSTED cannot be used
even though it should be possible.
EDIT:
s. Slack Thread https://graalvm.slack.com/archives/CP6RTC4LT/p1708435622691359
The error only occurs when running the application with the DefaultTruffleRuntime which seems to not support UNTRUSTED sandboxPolicy

-> base-ui can be ignored, just for complete reference because the original
project has two sub-modules
